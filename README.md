# ProximityScroll

A proof of concept web app that allows scrolling without touching the screen (just move your hand in front of the proximity sensor). It's made for mobile devices but sadly very limited in compatibility by the browsers.
Created alongside https://github.com/Aulig/mciot_wearable for the great Mobile Computing & Internet of Things lecture by Prof. Beigl at the KIT.
